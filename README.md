    ## How to execute this project in your machine
    
    *-1*
*First*, you have to install Node.js, React and React Native. 
    
    *-2* Clone this project and create an environment in your terminal.
    
    *-3* In your terminal, go to your project directory then type:
    
       *3.1*   cd server
          
                 yarn install
             
                 yarn dev
             
       *3.2*   cd web
          
                 yarn install

    *-4* Change the ip adress in the files with your own ip address.
           
           For example, change this code "app.listen(4445,'192.168.1.124');" with "app.listen(4445,'XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW');"
           
           You wan also change the port used is the 4445 port in you case is already used.
    
    ‚ùó To find your ip address, go to your terminal and type "ipconfig" and choose the ipv4 address.

    YEYYY! Your application is now working! üéâ
    
    
    *Unresolved Problems* Unfortunately, in the mobile app we couldn't extract the location points in the map from the database.
